- Degree of ownership — task execution vs end-to-end responsibility
- Decision-making authority and independence

## 3. Primary Competencies (Critical / Must-Have)
- Capabilities without which the candidate would fail
- WHY each competency is essential

## 4. Secondary Competencies (Value-Add)
- Capabilities that strengthen the profile but are not mandatory

## 5. Implicit & Unstated Expectations
- Skills, behaviors, or experience assumed but not written

## 6. Evaluation Biases & Hiring Signals

Rules: Total = exactly 100 points. Weight by actual hiring importance. Core competencies carry significantly higher weight. Depth and ownership matter more than surface exposure.

## 1. Skill & Competency Matrix
| Skill/Competency | Category | Weight | Strong Evidence | Weak Evidence |

## 2. Weighting Rationale
Explain each weight and trade-offs between overlapping skills.

## 3. Seniority Sensitivity
How do expectations shift for junior vs senior candidates?

## 4. Non-Negotiable Conditions
Competencies whose absence should trigger rejection.

Principles: Infer skills from role scope and career progression. Evaluate depth, ownership, outcomes — not just tool mentions. Assume experienced professionals may omit foundational skills.

## 1. Candidate Profile Overview
Apparent seniority, domain alignment, career trajectory.

## 2. Skill-by-Skill Assessment
For EACH skill in the matrix: evidence found (explicit or inferred), strength (Strong/Moderate/Weak/Missing), points awarded with justification.

## 3. Implicit Skill Inference
Skills likely present but not listed, with reasoning.

## 4. Gaps, Risks & Constraints
Missing or weak competencies. Critical vs trainable.

## 5. Final Scoring Summary
Total score out of 100. Category-wise breakdown.

## 6. Hiring Recommendation
Strong Fit / Moderate Fit / Weak Fit / Reject — with confidence level and rationale.

Purpose: Uncover experience that may exist but wasn't expressed in the CV. NOT an assessment — an enrichment exercise.

Principles:
- Never assume incompetence — assume possible omission
- Do NOT reference scores, gaps, or evaluation language
- Avoid yes/no questions — encourage 3–6 sentence responses
- Questions should translate naturally into CV bullet points

## 1. Role-Relevant Experience Clarification
2–4 questions on critical competencies with limited evidence.

## 2. Depth, Complexity & Proficiency
2–4 questions on scale, tools, environments, maturity.

## 3. Adjacent or Transferable Experience
2–4 questions identifying equivalent experience.

## 4. Implicit Seniority & Behavioral Capabilities
2–4 questions on leadership, influence, decision-making.

## 5. Ownership, Impact & Outcomes
2–4 questions on measurable outcomes and accountability.

Number all questions sequentially. No commentary — questions only, ready to send to the candidate.
